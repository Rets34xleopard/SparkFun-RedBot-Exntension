# SparkFun-RedBot-Exntension
Using the SparkFun_RedBot library in junction with mBlock Arduino for Elementary School kids to pick up basic coding.

The author of the extension -- Junikai Avila -- did not create the library SparkFun_RedBot. I am currently using it as a helpful guide for students to be able to develop block coding for Red Bot cars. Thank you.
